Your distribution was consistently exceeding this survey length by a large margin. You have been reimbursed for your remaining responses with account credit.","PPTermsAndConditions":"<li>Responses are not necessarily an even representation of your criteria, but will always match the criteria. We will generally provide a few extra responses to supplement in the case of speeders and other bad responses.<\/li> <li>All responses that terminated early due to end of survey branch logic or skip logic, will count towards the total number of good completes, with the exception of respondents that are flagged as 'Quota Met' or 'Screened-Out' in the End of Survey Block options.<\/li> <li>Respondents that terminate prematurely and are flagged as 'Quota Met' or 'Screened-Out' in the End of Survey Block options will decrement the Survey Incidence rate. If the Survey Incidence rate drops below 80%, your distribution will be stopped automatically, and you will be reimbursed for the remaining responses via account credit.<\/li> <li>Refunds are not given for incomplete responses, but you will be reimbursed for those respondents via account credit which can be used to purchase another panel.<\/li> <li>If you would like the help of a project manager to assist in setting up your survey and monitoring your distribution, <a clickcallback='Q.PurchasePanel.HeadsUpToolbar.showSurveyHelp(Contact)'>click here<\/a> to contact our panel management team. Otherwise a project manager will not be provided.<\/li> <li>You agree to all other <a clickcallback=\"Q.PurchasePanel.showTermsOfService\">terms and conditions documented here<\/a>.<\/li>","ScreenerQuestionQ":"What if I have screener questions that are not represented in the sample criteria?","ScreenerQuestionA":"Each sample finder respondent that terminates prematurely due to a filled quota, or a screener question will count as a paid response and contribute to the total number of good completes unless you specifically flag the response as a \u2018Screen-Out\u2019 or \u2018Quota-Met.\u2019 This is done in the End of Survey options dialog. ","IncidenceRateQ":"What is the survey incidence rate?","IncidenceRateA":"Survey Incidence Rate is the ratio of good completes (or respondents who successfully finished your survey) over the number of total responses. Flagging a response as \u2018Screen-Out\u2019 or \u2018Quota Met\u2019  will decrement the survey incidence rate.  This is done using the Flag Response feature in the End of Survey options. The \u2018Quota Met\u2019 flag is set automatically when the quota action is \u2018End Current Survey.\u2019  The \u2018Screen-Out\u2019 flag is set when using the \u2019Screen-Out Response\u2019 feature, or when \u2018Do not record survey response\u2019 is selected in the End of Survey options.  Any response not flagged as \u2018Screen-Out\u2019 or \u2018Quota Met\u2019 will count as a paid response and contribute to the total number of good completes.","SurveyLengthQ":"How do I estimate survey length?","SurveyLengthA":"There are many ways of estimating the survey length. An easy way of doing it is by timing a few test responses, and taking an average.  We have also found that 10 Seconds for a Multiple Choice question and each row of a Matrix question, and 30 seconds for each text entry box produce a fairly accurate representation.","EndSurveyOptionsQ":"Why are end of survey options ignored for Sample Finder Respondents?","EndSurveyOptionsA":"Each Sample Finder respondent will be automatically redirected to our sample-provider\u2019s website and all survey termination options will be ignored. This includes end of survey messages, redirects, individual response reports, public reports, and scoring summaries.","QuotasQ":"How do survey quotas work with sample finder?","QuotasA":"Quotas continue to work as expected. However, if you have a quota in your survey that doesn\u2019t correspond to a Sample Finder distribution, respondents from the sample finder distribution who terminate prematurely due to a full quota will count against the survey incidence.  Sample Finder is limited on the criteria you can chose from and only allows you to select Gender, Age and Country.

These responses are flagged as preview responses, and may be removed from the View Results section. Additionally, the panel widget allows you to start and pause a distribution at any time. So you can turn it on, collect a few responses, then pause it.  Once your survey is ready, you may resume the distribution.","EndDistributionQ":"What will happen if I end my distribution?","EndDistributionA":"Panelists for this distribution will stop being directed to your survey, and you will be reimbursed via account credit for all remaining responses.","CollectResponsesQ":"How do I know if I am getting responses?","CollectResponsesA":"You can see the responses in progress in the View Results section under \"Responses.\" Once a response is recorded, the distribution stats will be updated in sample finder.","FAQ":"Frequently Asked Questions","GetHelp":"Get Help","LikeSampleFinder":"Like Sample Finder?
